# snakeGame

This is a project to implement different AI solutions to solve the classic snake game. All of the AI implementations are my own however the game itself is built from a tutorial by techwithtim linked below.

BFS, DFS, Hamiltonian Cycles, Deep Learning

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/stschoberg/snakeGame.git
```
## Usage

The game has various runmodes
1. keys - the user plays the game with the arrowkeys
2. random - the ai chooses a random path with no respect for the snack
3. shortest - the ai chooses the shortest path to the snack
4. better-shortest - the ai chooses the shortest path to the path but will avoid its own body

```bash
python3 playSnakeGame.py --option # where option is a mode listed above
```
